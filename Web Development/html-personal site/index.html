<hr>
    Ty Kirkham
  </h1>
  <p>I'm a simple man, who is always hustling. Not for the money
    but for the satisfaction of feeling like im accomplished. Not by
    feeling i'm great or fueling my ego, but just knowing that
    I have not wasted the valued time that I have been given on this
    Earth. For as long as I could remember I wanted to be an attoney, but after
    shadowing that jobs lifestyle as a paralegal, I realized that
    it wasn't the career path for me. So I got over my fear of math
    and passed calculus I for engineers and it was on from that point on.
    I did a brief semester of thermodynamics and physics in college. I met
    a cool fellow nerd named Alvin who talked me into taking one of my
    math electives in computer science. After taking the class I though to myself
    "what have I been doing avoiding this dope ass profession". I am now dabbling
    in all kinds of languages, but i've realized i'm a visual person, and all
    my focus is on the front end of web-development using html, css, javascript
    node.js, and sql.</p>
